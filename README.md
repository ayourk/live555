# UNSUPPORTED Unofficial live555
A history constructed of (most of) the live555 release tarballs.<br />
Please note:  This repository is merely for educational and historical purposes.  It is not designed to be used in production.  For production ready code, please use the latest source available from the [Official Main Site](http://www.live555.com/liveMedia/).

This repository is similar to [Ray Lehtiniemi's Live555 repository](https://github.com/rayl/live555) but more up to date and with release tarballs along the way.  Some of the release tarballs are no longer available.  See https://wx3sweden.se/live555-archive/archive-status.txt for more info.

The source tarballs were retrieved from: 
* https://wx3sweden.se/live555-archive/
* https://download.videolan.org/pub/contrib/live555/
* https://src.rrz.uni-hamburg.de/files/src/live555/

The original author does not believe in version control (See [FAQ#2.6](http://www.live555.com/liveMedia/faq.html#no-source-code-repository)) and also doesn't provide access to old versions (See [FAQ#2.5](http://www.live555.com/liveMedia/faq.html#old-versions)) hence the only way to get access to old versions of code is from the source tarball sites listed above or via people such as myself that create these version control repositories (or from people who have saved versions not listed in the source tarball sites above).
